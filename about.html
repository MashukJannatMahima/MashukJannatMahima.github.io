    <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Mashuk Jannat Mahima</strong>, a final-year undergraduate student in the Department of CSE at BRAC University. I’m passionate about <strong>Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare</strong>, especially for the early screening of <strong>autism and neurodevelopmental disabilities</strong>.</p>

    <p>My technical journey includes projects in <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong>, <strong>Blockchain</strong>, and <strong>Database Systems</strong>. I've developed assistive tools using <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and worked with technologies such as <strong>Python, Solidity, HTML, CSS, MySQL</strong>, and more.</p>

    <p>Beyond academics, I’m a <strong>National Councillor of SWID Bangladesh</strong>, actively contributing as a member of the <strong>Education & Research</strong> and <strong>Cultural Subcommittees</strong>. I have coordinated impactful projects in partnership with:</p>
